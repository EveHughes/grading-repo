Use an organized repo with a detailed README and a Python project. Thoroughly document code and include a preamble, comments, nice structure, and style code with styler or lintr. Use seeds appropriately. Avoid leaving install.packages() in the code unless handled sophisticatedly. Exclude unnecessary files from the repo; avoid hard-coded paths and setwd(). Use base pipe not magrittr pipe. Comment on and close all GitHub issues. Deal with all branches.
