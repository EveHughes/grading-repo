Title	
0 - 'Poor or not done';
1 - 'Yes';
2 - 'Exceptional'	

An informative title is included that explains the story, and ideally tells the reader what happens at the end of it. 'Paper X' is not an informative title. Use a subtitle to convey the main finding. Do not use puns (you can break this rule once you're experienced).
