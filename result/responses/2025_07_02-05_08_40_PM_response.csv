Abstract,4,"The abstract is well-written and presents a clear and concise summary of the analysis. It outlines what was done, the findings of the analysis, and the implications of these findings. The language used is non-technical and would be understandable for a non-specialist audience. Good job!"
"Author, date, and repo",2,Evelyn Hughes is clearly mentioned as the author. The date of submission is given in an unambiguous format (05/12/2025). The link to the GitHub repo is also provided.
Captions,2,All figures and tables have detailed captions that provide clear context for the data being presented. The captions are informative and can stand alone from the main text. The author has followed the guidelines proficiently.
Python cited,1,Python is appropriately referenced in the main content under the 'Data' section and is accordingly cited in the reference list.
Cross-references,1,The paper does a great job of cross-referencing. All tables and figures are appropriately numbered and referred to in the text. The introduction includes a telegraphing paragraph that clearly outlines the rest of the paper using cross-references.
Data,6,"The dataset choice was well justified, providing relevant data on respiratory outbreaks in healthcare institutions in Toronto. However, there was little discussion on whether similar data sources could have been used or why they were not used. The preprocessing of data was well defined, and the appropriate variable selection was explained elaborately. There may have been some issues with the data, as the author mentions the possibility of reporting issues or detection biases influencing the results. Further steps to manage this issue should have been incorporated during the data cleaning process."
Graphs and tables,4,"The graphs and tables in this project are exceptional. They are well-formatted, clear, and digestible. They serve a clear purpose and are fully self-contained, appropriately sized, colored, and labelled. The use of labels is meticulous, and the author ensured to avoid using variable names as labels. The tables are formatted correctly with an appropriate number of decimal places and comma separators for thousands. The project doesn't use boxplots. Overall, the visual representation of the data excellently supports the analysis."
Introduction,4,"The introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the topic and clearly outlines the study's aims and objectives. It discusses the broader context of the pandemic-related restrictions, changes in patterns of contagious respiratory diseases, and the subsequent implications for healthcare facilities. The author has successfully identified a gap in the existing literature and articulated the significance of their study to fill this gap. Lastly, the structure of the rest of the paper is detailed, allowing readers to anticipate the following sections. Overall, the introduction is well-structured and informative."
Measurement,4,"The student provided a thorough discussion of how the phenomenon of interest, respiratory outbreaks, is converted into an entry in the dataset. The student not only elaborated on the variables of interest and how they are defined but also clearly explained the issues or errors associated with the data. The description of the phenomenon and the data conversion process is detailed, well-structured and uses proper citation. This meets the criteria for the 'Exceptional' category."
Prose,4,"The project is written in a comprehensive and structured manner. However, there are instances of using words/phrases from the prohibited list such as ""Additionally"", ""While"", ""it becomes relevant"" that could have been replaced to make the prose more concise and coherent."
Referencing,4,"Excellent job with in-text citations and in the bibliography. All data sources, software, publications, and other relevant materials are properly cited and referenced. The author used correct BibTeX formatting rules and conventions. The author did a good job of acknowledging relevant resources without overusing direct quotes, and fairly credited all outside material."
Reproducible workflow,4,"The project demonstrates exceptional practice in terms of reproducibility. The repository is clean and well-organized, with a detailed README file. Each Python script contains a clear preamble outlining the script's purpose, pre-requisites, and author's contact. The code is well-structured and contains helpful comments for easy understanding. There are no unnecessary files or hardcoded paths, and scripts use seeds appropriately for replication. The use of base pipe instead of magrittr pipe further enhances reproducibility. The code adheres to good style conventions. The project thus meets all criteria for an 'Exceptional' score in 'Reproducible workflow'."
Data Graphs and Summary Statistics,2,"The student has effectively used graphs and tables to visualize the downloaded data. They have done a great job in creating data graphs with subtitles and labels. Plus, they have provided a thorough explanation of what each graph represents. They've also provided summary statistics of the data which strengthens the report. They've explained these statistics and their significance, which greatly assists in understanding the data. Overall, the presentation of the data is clear and effective, hence the maximum score for this category."
Tests,4,"Exceptional

The student has written extensive and thorough test suites for both the simulated and actual datasets. The test suites are in separate scripts. The student used testthat for the test suite, covering a vast range of aspects in the dataset such as ensuring no missing values, checking that all columns are of the expected type, testing that certain column values add up to total counts, and validating that the shape of the dataset matches the expected shape."
Title,2,"The project title ""Respiratory Outbreak Trends in Toronto Healthcare Institutions Across the COVID-19 Pandemic"" is informative and clearly presents the subject of the project. The subtitle ""The Response of Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Diseases to COVID-19 Pandemic Policies"" gives additional insight into what the project will be discussing. The title and subtitle combined provide a very clear picture of what to expect."
