Abstract,4,"The abstract excellently explains the purpose of the study, which is to identify the trends of respiratory infections in Toronto healthcare institutions during the implementation and lifting of COVID-19 preventative policies. It presents the findings of the analysis, namely the decrease in reported Coronavirus outbreaks and subsequent rise in non-Coronavirus respiratory outbreaks post-pandemic. The abstract also emphasizes the relevance of the study, highlighting its potential to inform healthcare facilities' outbreak mitigation and management strategies. Overall, the abstract is clear, concise, and well-formatted, making it suitable for a non-specialist audience."
"Author, date, and repo",2,The author's name is Evelyn Hughes. The date of submission is 05/12/2025. A link to the GitHub repo is also clearly provided within the paper. Well done!
Captions,2,"All tables and figures have comprehensive, descriptive, and meaningful captions. They clearly explain the main point and the information being conveyed, independent of the accompanying text."
Python cited,1,Python is properly cited and referenced in the data analysis paper.
Cross-references,1,The paper has done an excellent job of numbering figures and tables and referring to them properly in the text. The telegraphing paragraph in the introduction does a good job of cross-referencing the rest of the paper. All the references are adequately cited throughout the document.
Data,8,"The paper discusses all relevant variables and explains why they are critical to the analysis. It thoroughly explains the sources of the data, as well as other datasets that could have been utilized. The paper also highlights potential issues with the data and suggests future research to clarify these problems. Moreover, both graphs and tables are employed to illustrate the variables effectively. However, there are a few areas that could have been improved. For instance, more in-depth exploration of the relationships between variables could have strengthened the paper. The author also could have delved deeper into the data cleaning processes."
Graphs and tables,4,The paper includes a good number of graphs and tables that aid in visualizing the data and understanding the statistics. Each graph and table was properly formatted and labeled clearly. The analysis makes good use of colors in the graphs and the tables are well structured with clear labels. The usage of code for generating graphs and tables adds to the clarity and cohesiveness of the paper.
Measurement,4,"The paper provided an extensive explanation of the data source used - Outbreaks in Toronto Healthcare Institutions data by Toronto Public Health, touching on the different points each entry accounts for, definitions used to classify terms such as outbreaks, and variables of interest relevant to the analysis. The author also identified and addressed specific limitations and potential biases in the data, suggesting areas for further research to validate the dataset."
Prose,6,"The prose is superbly written and meets the highest standard of clarity, coherence, and conciseness. The author uses mature language and the entire paper is free from typos, spelling errors, or grammatical mistakes. They don't use any of the forbidden phrases or words, and the language used is clear and professional. The readability of the paper is enhanced by the author's exceptional mastery of language."
Referencing,4,"The paper correctly cites all data, software, literature, and other materials both in-text and in the reference list. It uses the correct syntax for in-text citations and appropriately formats the BibTex references. All R packages and other aspects are correctly capitalized. The student did a great job with referencing, no improvements needed."
Reproducible workflow,3,"The repository has been properly organized and the code is well-commented, structured accordingly and comprehensive. Seeds have been used appropriately. The code does not contain any unnecessary packages implementation. The author avoids hard-coded paths. However, the README file and the handling of Github issues and branches are not included or addressed in the provided code."
Title,1,"The title and subtitle clearly and accurately represent the contents of the paper, but they do not give away the end story. The use of medical and geographic terminologies also adds clarity to the context of the study. Adding more key findings to the subtitle might make it more informative."
