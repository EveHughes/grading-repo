Abstract,4,"The abstract is clear and concise, explaining the purpose of the study, the method used, and the significance of the findings. It mentions the research question, the method (data analysis and visualization), the primary findings (decrease in Coronavirus outbreaks and increase in non-Coronavirus respiratory outbreaks), and explains their potential implications for healthcare facilities. The language used is accessible and avoids overly technical jargon, making it suitable for a non-specialist audience. This provides an excellent preview for the rest of the report."
"Author, date, and repo",2,"The author's name, the date of submission, and a link to the GitHub repo are clearly provided in the abstract of the project. There is also a direct link to the dataset used."
Captions,2,"All tables and figures contain detailed and meaningful captions that clarify their content even without accompanying text. The captions are informative, complementing the content and providing additional explanation. Great detail oriented job!"
Python cited,1,Python is properly cited and referenced in the main content and the reference list.
Cross-references,1,"The project makes good use of cross-references throughout the report. All figures, tables, and sections are appropriately numbered and referred to in the main text. The introduction includes a clear outline and each section is referenced appropriately."
Data,4,"The data used was relevant and appropriate for the research question, the source was cited and the variables of interest were described in detail. However, exploration of data cleaning, mention of similar datasets, and a discussion of why certain variables were utilized or constructed was not included, which reduces the overall grade. Alternatively, if the data cleaning process did not have any significant impact on the analysis, it would be beneficial to mention this to provide further context."
Graphs and tables,4,"All graphs and tables in the submission are excellent. They are clear, well-formatted, and are effectively utilized for the project's purpose. The graphs are well labeled with appropriate font size and coloring. Tables are structured well, with appropriate data elements visible. Each graph and table serves a clear purpose, and they supplement the written content perfectly. The inclusion of Python code to generate the tables and graphs additionally demonstrates an impressive understanding of data manipulation and visualization. Great work!"
Introduction,4,"The introduction is exceptional. It provides the broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on healthcare facilities in Toronto, identifies a clear gap in examining the effects of lifting COVID-19 protocols on respiratory diseases, explains the aims of the paper, states the main findings, and emphasises the importance of the findings in informing healthcare policy. Moreover, the structure of the paper is described in detail. Major terminologies and concepts used throughout the paper are explained. The grammatical structure of the sentences is excellent, the language used is clear, concise, and engaging. The introduction is well-worded and flows smoothly, making it easy for readers to understand the paper's objectives, methods, and outcomes. The importance of the research is clearly stated, backed by comprehensive references. Therefore, the introduction scores an exceptional grade."
Measurement,4,"The student provided a comprehensive examination of their dataset. They detailed the collection process, identified potential limitations, and clarified definitions and categorisation processes within it. The data was thoughtfully processed and presented in a clear, digestible manner. The measurement section was detailed, concise, and well-structured in line with the rubric requirements."
Prose,6,"The prose is written in a very clear and coherent manner. There are no noticeable typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors. The language is mature and the author has strictly adhered to the vocabulary guidelines. Explanations are provided in a concise manner and the overall presentation is exceptional. The structure is logical, making it easy for the reader to follow the arguments and understand the content. Good job!"
Referencing,4,All references have been properly cited in the text. The author has correctly formatted the reference list using BibTeX.
Reproducible workflow,3,"The workflow is comprehensive and well-structured. The repo is clean and all necessary code files are included. Functions and packages are properly sourced at the beginning of each script, ensuring easy reproducibility. However, the README file could be improved with a project overview and detailed instructions on how to run the code. Despite this, it is still impressive."
Data Graphs and Summary Statistics,2,"The project delivers various forms of graphs (line plots, bar charts), tables showcasing raw and summary statistics, and thoughtful descriptions of variables. All data is thoroughly discussed and clearly presented, facilitating easy understanding of trends and patterns. Reports also contain appropriate contextual discussion about potential inaccuracies or limitations in the data (such as reporting issues and detection biases)."
Tests,4,"Exceptional

There are extensive test suites for both the simulated and cleaned data. The tests appropriately checked for data types, missing values, and correct data counts. The tests are organized in a clear and sophisticated way, and are separated into separate scripts per dataset as required by the rubric. Good use of the unittest framework for test structure and execution. Unittest is a capable and extensible framework that is considered a standard for testing in Python. They made sure to have setUp functions to reduce redundancy in their code. The tests were focused and accurately tested the data."
Title,2,"The project has an informative title and subtitle that clearly indicates the topic of the project and communicates the primary findings. It captures the important elements of the work and situates it within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no grammatical errors, and the language and syntax used is precise and concise."
