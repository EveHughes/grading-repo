Criterion,Score,Comment
abstract.txt,4,"The abstract is well-written, clear, and concise. It effectively addresses what was done, the key findings, and their significance in a manner accessible to a non-specialist audience. It clearly highlights the broader implications of the research."
authordaterepo.txt,2,"The author's name, a clear date in an unambiguous format, and a GitHub link are all included."
captions.txt,2,"All figures and tables have clear, detailed captions that effectively articulate the main points without an overemphasis on the figure/table type."
citation.txt,1,"Python and its associated libraries are properly cited in both the main content and reference list, satisfying the citation requirement."
crossreferences.txt,1,"All figures, tables, and equations are properly labeled, numbered, and referred to in the text using cross-references. The telegraphing paragraph in the introduction effectively cross-references the subsequent sections of the paper."
data.txt,8,"The project provides a clear description of variables of interest, their relevance, and how they were processed. The use of clear graphs and tables supports this explanation effectively, focusing on key variables and their trends without overloading with unnecessary details. Cleaning aspects and limitations are addressed appropriately."
graphsandtables.txt,1,"While graphs and tables are included and well-labeled, they are not created with ggplot2 or tinytable as requested. Additionally, some tables are overly complex and lack appropriate formatting such as comma-separated values for thousands and rounded decimal places. The graphs could benefit from better formatting and color coding for clarity."
introduction.txt,4,"The introduction provides comprehensive context, defines the research gap, explains the study's aims, methods, key findings, and significance, and includes a clear outline of the paper's structure. It's self-contained and well-organized."
measurement.txt,4,"The project thoroughly discusses how respiratory outbreaks are defined, the sources of the dataset, and the variables of interest. It also explains how specific agents contribute to measurements and discusses potential data validity concerns, such as low outbreak counts and detection bias."
prose.txt,6,"The writing is well-structured, concise, and grammatically correct. The arguments are articulated clearly without unnecessary words or prohibited phrases, maintaining a mature and professional tone throughout."
referencing.txt,4,"All data, software, and literature are properly cited in-text using the correct formatting. References are included in a well-structured BibTeX reference list, correctly capitalized and appropriately labeled. There's no misuse of citation commands such as (@my_cite) instead of [@my_cite]."
reproducible.txt,3,"The project is well-structured with thorough preambles and appropriate comments. Seeds are used to ensure reproducibility, and there are no hard-coded paths. However, there is no mention of a README or clear instructions to reproduce the work, and handling of unnecessary files and GitHub issues is unclear."
summarystats.txt,2,"The project includes graphs and tables for observations, such as yearly outbreak count and respiratory disease composition, with accompanying explanations. Summary statistics are provided for multiple analyses, and relationships between variables are addressed."
tests.txt,3,"The project has separate test scripts for both simulated and actual datasets, with comprehensive test cases to validate data integrity and type conformity. However, the use of unittest is functional but lacks the sophistication of packages like testthat or great expectations."
title.txt,2,"The title and subtitle are exceptionally clear and informative, effectively providing context and the main findings of the study."
