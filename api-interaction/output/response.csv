Abstract,4,"The abstract of the paper provides an overview of what was done, what was found, and why it matters. It clearly presents the study's objective, methodology, key findings, and implications, while also emphasizing the relevance of these findings for informing healthcare facilities' policies and management practices related to disease outbreaks. Overall, it was well-structured and concise, making it easily understandable to non-specialist audiences. Exceptionally done."
"Author, date, and repo",2,"The author, date of submission, and the GitHub repo link are all clearly presented."
Captions,2,All tables and figures have detailed and meaningful captions which provide context and explain the data shown in a clear manner.
Python cited,1,Python is properly cited in the '#Data' section and is included in the reference list.
Cross-references,1,"The paper thoroughly uses cross-references in each section. All the figures, tables, and relevant data are well-referred to in the text. Good job!"
Data,9,"The author thoroughly presents and discusses the dataset, including all variables of interest, compares it with alternatives, and explains the choice of this very dataset in the broader context of the study. All variables used in the analysis are well explained in terms of their relevance to the study, but the variable construction process could be more detailed. High-level data cleaning is briefly introduced, but the actual process is not described in detail. Excellent use of data tables and graphs to help the reader understand the structure and trends in the dataset. It would be helpful to provide some more information about the structure and distribution of some of the variables. The author not only explains the dataset well but also touches upon potential issues with its validity."
Introduction,4,"The introduction is exceptionally well composed. It sets the context, identifies the study's purpose, specifies the research gap, provides a summary of what was done and what was found, and outlines the importance of the research, all within precise language. The structure of the paper is also nicely described, providing the reader a roadmap. A reader can simply read the introduction and understand the essential elements of the work."
Measurement,4,"The student provides a comprehensive and clear explanation of the measurement process. Concepts and procedures are accurately and comprehensively outlined for each variable in the dataset. The student provides information about the data collection procedures, details about the variables of interest, and addresses possible biases in the explanation comprehensively. The student also discusses some issues that could affect the validity of the data. The discussion and presentation of the measurement demonstrate an exceptional understanding of the dataset and the phenomena it represents."
Prose,6,"The assignment is clear, concise, and mature. It does not use any prohibited words and is largely free of typos or spelling mistakes. The writing takes complex concepts and presents them in a way that is easy to understand."
Referencing,4,"The referencing in this paper is done correctly. All data, software, literature, and other relevant material are properly cited in-text and included in the reference list using BibTeX. Proper use of (@my_cite) and [@my_cite] was observed. R packages and all other aspects are capitalized correctly, and the name and use of double braces in the BibTex file is correct."
Reproducible workflow,3,"The organized repository includes detailed conventions, and the codes are well-structured and commented thoroughly. The paths are not hard-coded and there are no unnecessary files. The seeds are used appropriately, improving the reproducibility of the workflow. However, the project could be improved with a more sophisticated method for installing packages and by actively using GitHub issues and properly handling all branches. It's an impressive work overall but there's room for minor improvements."
Tests,4,"Exceptional

The suites of tests are written for both the simulated and actual datasets, which are in separate scripts, as per the requirements. Each test suite is extensive, testing for missing data, specific data type requirements for specific Columns, as well as testing conditions on the data (like total count). The tests are well-structured and utilize the unittest module effectively for assert statements to validate the data."
Title,2,The title accurately sums up the research and gives key insights to the reader. The subtitle provides additional information. Well executed overall.
